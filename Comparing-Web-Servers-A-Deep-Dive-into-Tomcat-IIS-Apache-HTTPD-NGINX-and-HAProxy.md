## Introduction
---------------

As web applications continue to evolve, so do the needs of modern web servers. In this document, we will explore the world of web servers by comparing five popular options: Tomcat, IIS (Internet Information Services), Apache HTTPD, NGINX, and HAProxy. We'll delve into their use cases, pros and cons, differences, and example configurations to help you make an informed decision for your next web project.

## Overview of Web Servers
-------------------------

Before we dive into the details of each web server, let's take a high-level look at what they are and why they're used.

A web server is a software program that hosts and serves web pages to clients via the internet. Each web server has its strengths and weaknesses, making some more suitable for certain types of projects than others.

### Key Features of Web Servers

*   **Request handling**: Accepting incoming HTTP requests from clients
*   **Resource management**: Managing resources like memory, CPU, and disk space
