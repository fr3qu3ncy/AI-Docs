======================================

**Summary**

Cooking scrambled eggs in an air fryer is a game-changing technique that yields perfectly cooked, fluffy, and delicious eggs every time. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to cook scrambled eggs in an air fryer, covering the basics, advanced techniques, and troubleshooting tips.

## Getting Started
-------------------

### Equipment Needed

* An air fryer with a minimum capacity of 2-3 quarts
* A mixing bowl
* Whisk or fork for whisking eggs
* Non-stick cooking spray (optional)
* Fresh eggs
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Optional add-ins like chopped chives, shredded cheese, or diced vegetables

### Basic Ingredients

* 4 large eggs
* 2 tablespoons milk or cream
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Understanding Air Fryer Cooking

Air fryers use a combination of hot air circulation and rapid cooking to produce crispy exterior and tender interior. When cooking scrambled eggs in an air fryer, it's essential to understand the science behind this process:

* The air fryer cooks the eggs evenly throughout, ensuring they are cooked to a consistent doneness.
* The Maillard reaction, a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars, occurs when the eggs meet high heat, contributing to the rich flavor and browning.

### Preheating and Preparation

Before cooking scrambled eggs in an air fryer:

1. **Preheat** your air fryer to 350°F (175°C) for at least 5 minutes.
2. Prepare the egg mixture: Crack 4 large eggs into a bowl, add 2 tablespoons milk or cream, salt, and pepper to taste. Whisk the eggs until they are well-blended and slightly frothy.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Pour the egg mixture** into the air fryer basket or tray.
2. **Spray with non-stick cooking spray**, if desired, to prevent sticking.
3. **Close the air fryer lid** and set the timer according to your preference (see Advanced Techniques below).
4. Cook for 5 minutes at a temperature of 350°F (175°C). Halfway through, gently stir the eggs using a spatula or fork.

### Tips and Tricks

* **Don't overmix**: Scrambled eggs should be cooked until they are just set, with some moistness remaining.
* **Check doneness**: Use either the visual inspection method (scrambled eggs should be light, fluffy, and barely set) or temperature check (internal temperature reaches 160°F / 71°C).

### Customizing Your Scramble

Experiment with different add-ins to create unique flavor combinations:

* **Bacon Lover's Scramble**: Add crumbled cooked bacon for a smoky twist.
* **Veggie Delight**: Stir in diced bell peppers, onions, or mushrooms for added nutrients and flavor.
* **Cheese Heaven**: Sprinkle shredded cheddar, feta, or goat cheese on top of the eggs for an extra burst of flavor.

### Cooking Times and Temperatures

Adjust cooking times and temperatures to suit your preference:

* **Soft scramble**: Cook at 300°F (150°C) for 4-5 minutes.
* **Medium scramble**: Cook at 325°F (165°C) for 3-4 minutes.
* **Hard scramble**: Cook at 375°F (190°C) for 2-3 minutes.

## Troubleshooting and FAQs

### Common Issues and Solutions

* **Undercooked eggs**: Increase cooking time or temperature, but be cautious not to overcook.
